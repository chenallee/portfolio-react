I also used create react app so I didn't have to configure webpack myself.",

I'd like to revisit this project with my new knowledge to see if I can refactor it with hooks or just clean it up. Also I'd like to override a lot of the Bootstrap styles to make the UI more interesting or just write my own styles. It might also be beneficial to allow the user to select a different UI view."
