# react portfolio
## description
An iteration of my web development portfolio made in React, featuring 6 projects. Reuses a Header and Footer component across all pages, React Router for navigation, and a Project component used for all projects. Link to deployed above or [here](https://portfolio-react-lyart.now.sh/).

## technologies
Made with [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and [Bootstrap's React Components](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

[Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) used for particle effect in the background.

## final thoughts
Although there's a lot of things I want to tweak, I'm satisfied with the design I chose to go with. I spent the most time trying to decide what color palette and layout to use as well as optimizing spacing for different size screens. Although I didn't end up implementing my initial design I might attempt it later. I used Bootstrap components in an effort to make things easier on myself, but overriding their styles ended up being a lot of effort. 

When I have some more time, I'd like to make the project page more dynamic. After that, I'll add some more CSS animations, an avatar made in CSS, and more details to the projects, potentially with accordions or modals. Since I don't have a lot of professional experience, I'd like to talk more about the projects on my portfolio and list the objective, solution, and results. I think I may need to implement [React's Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to track which project is open.

Since I want to do more creative work, I didn't want to go for too corporate of a design, but I hope this is professional enough. When I'm unsure, I tend to err on the more professional side so I went out of my comfort zone and tried to let my cheeky side show.

If you happen to have read this far, I'd love some advice on my work and how I can better present myself. Thanks! ðŸ‘‹
